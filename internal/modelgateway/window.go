// Rolling-window accounting shared by the quota check (how much has this tenant
// spent recently?) and the anomaly signals (how does recent behavior compare to
// this tenant's own history?).
//
// Both need "the last N minutes", not "since process start", so a fixed counter
// is the wrong shape: a tenant that blew its budget an hour ago should be able
// to work again. A true sliding window would need per-request timestamps and
// unbounded memory, so this approximates one with a ring of fixed buckets —
// the standard trade. Resolution is window/bucketCount; a tenant can overshoot
// by at most one bucket's worth at a window boundary, which for a spend guard
// is the right way to be wrong (bounded, and in the generous direction).

// bucketCount is the ring size. Twelve buckets put the resolution at 5s for a
// 1-minute window and 5m for an hour — fine enough that boundary overshoot is
// small, coarse enough that the ring stays cheap to sum on every request.
